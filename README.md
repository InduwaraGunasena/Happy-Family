In today's busy world, families are different now compared to the past. Before, parents had more time for 
their families, making their bonds stronger. But nowadays, father, mother or both parents work a lot, and 
kids are busy with school and focus on their own things. So, families don't spend much time together, 
maybe it limits to during dinner. Even when there's time, it's hard to manage or plan well, and decisions 
might not suit everyone. Also, some family members might be far away or busy with screens, making kids 
feel unhappy and distant. Additionally, these geographical distances or preoccupation with digital devices 
further separates some family members, impacting the overall happiness of the family and the mental 
well-being of children. 

To solve this, we're using AI to bring families closer. Our software collects diverse perceptions, including 
audio, visual, or text data, from all family members and neighbors. Leveraging AI algorithms, the software 
aims to discover optimal solutions for enriching this time with happiness, love, and enjoyment, fostering 
a new chapter of familial joy. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project supposed to make a mobile app including AI powerd chat bot called 'Nova', social media for each family and relevent suggestion list for making happy.
> But this app doesn't have those features. ***ONLY HAVE ITS INTERFACES**. Other features are implemented correctly.
