In today's busy world, families are different now compared to the past. Before, parents had more time for 
their families, making their bonds stronger. But nowadays, father, mother or both parents work a lot, and 
kids are busy with school and focus on their own things. So, families don't spend much time together, 
maybe it limits to during dinner. Even when there's time, it's hard to manage or plan well, and decisions 
might not suit everyone. Also, some family members might be far away or busy with screens, making kids 
feel unhappy and distant. Additionally, these geographical distances or preoccupation with digital devices 
further separates some family members, impacting the overall happiness of the family and the mental 
well-being of children. 

To solve this, we're using AI to bring families closer. Our software collects diverse perceptions, including 
audio, visual, or text data, from all family members and neighbors. Leveraging AI algorithms, the software 
aims to discover optimal solutions for enriching this time with happiness, love, and enjoyment, fostering 
a new chapter of familial joy. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is intended to develop a mobile app featuring an AI-powered chatbot called 'Nova,' a social media platform for each family, and relevant suggestions to enhance family happiness. However, this app ONLY INCLUDES ITS INTERFACES. Other features are correctly implemented.

## Project Files
This project includes both frontend and backend code, along with additional files. Below is a description of the directories included in this project:

| Folder Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| backend | Contains Node.js backend code with a MongoDB database. |
| documents | Includes our proposal, as well as a document explaining how to use the app. |
| figma design | Contains our initial frontend design file. |
| frontend | Includes all necessary files for the Flutter frontend app. |
| images | Contains screenshots of each page of the app. |

You can find more detailed information inside each folder.

## Message from the developers
We welcome contributions to this project. Our goal is to fully develop this app to achieve its intended purpose. However, we haven't reached that level yet due to the lack of a proper dataset to train the AI model. As a result, we decided to pivot the app towards a social media platform to collect data. You can explore this interface in the **FamilyHub** section of the side drawer. Also, we included other various features to attract people to this platform (message service, reminders). The main problem we faced after this was the privacy of the user's data. Additionally, there are other issues that need attention, and we highly value your contributions to help this project succeed.
